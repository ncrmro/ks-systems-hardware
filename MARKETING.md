## The Problem with Existing SFF Cases

Existing small form factor cases are a total pain to work with. They often require invasive disassembly for routine maintenance:

- **Motherboard removal just to swap a PSU** - Want to upgrade your power supply? Better set aside an afternoon to tear down your entire system first.
- **Unscrewing a dozen screws and disconnecting the power button** - Before you can even remove the outer shell, you're hunting for that one proprietary screw hidden behind a cable.
- **Cable management nightmares** - Tight tolerances with zero consideration for serviceability means every component change becomes a puzzle.
- **Thermal compromises** - Ventilation is often an afterthought, leaving your components throttling under load.

## The Keystone Approach

Keystone Hardware takes a different approach: **modular, serviceable, and expandable**.

### Tool-Free Access
Panels are designed for quick removal without disassembling half your system.

### Modular Configurations
One base platform, multiple configurations:
- **Minimal** - Compact Mini-ITX + Flex ATX PSU
- **NAS 2-disk** - Add storage underneath with passive chimney airflow
- **NAS many-disk** - Scale up to 5-8 HDDs with active cooling
- **GPU** - Full-size graphics card support with all I/O facing bottom

### Thermal-First Design
Honeycomb ventilation panels and chimney airflow patterns are built into the design, not bolted on as an afterthought.

### 3D Printable
Open source OpenSCAD designs mean you can print, modify, and iterate on your own case.
